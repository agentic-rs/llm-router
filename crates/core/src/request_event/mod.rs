//! Event payload types for the `tokn-requests` pipeline.
//!
//! These types live in `tokn-core` so that the workspace's
//! [`tokn_core::event::Event`] enum can embed a [`Requests(RequestEvent)`]
//! variant without inverting the dep graph (requests already depends on
//! tokn-core).
//!
//! Three payload shapes are supported as peers under
//! [`RequestEventPayload`]:
//!
//! * [`StageEvent`] — a closed enum of lifecycle/observation variants
//!   the runner emits at well-defined points (Started, per-stage
//!   summaries, Error, Completed). Subscribers `match` on them.
//! * [`RecordEvent`] — transport-adjacent captures that sit alongside the
//!   stage lifecycle (inbound connection facts, outbound wire-truth,
//!   parsed usage). Split from `StageEvent` so subscribers that only care
//!   about one axis don't pay a match-arm tax for the other.
//! * [`CustomEvent`] — an `Any`-typed escape hatch for middleware /
//!   decorator stages (e.g. retry, cache) to publish their own
//!   structured records without modifying either of the closed enums.
//!
//! The event bus itself is `tokn_core::event::EventBus` (a tokio broadcast
//! channel); requests publishes `tokn_core::event::Event::Requests(RequestEvent
//! { ... })` directly onto it.
//!
//! [`Requests(RequestEvent)`]: crate::event::Event::Requests
